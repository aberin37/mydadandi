    <h2>Hi my name is Annabel. When I was 12 I lost my father. I created this cheap, poorly executed blog to talk about my experiences. I want this to be a creative outlet to talk about a big part of my life, and to let more people learn about me through it. Please, If you are a child who has lost a family member, feel free to reach out, I want this to be an inclusive open space to talk and express ourselves.</h3>

    	<p>Everything I am writing about is a collection of thoughts I have been building up for seven years. They can appear as rude, arrogant, mean, senile, cynical, sarcastic, genuine, fake, or however else you perceive them. Please understand they are coming from a place of feeling misunderstood. I am extremely insecure about publically displaying my writing but keeping these feelings pent up is even more difficult. This may appear like it is meant for specific people and PLEASE understand it is for mostly myself. I just wanted to share it so people have an idea of the way I’m thinking. Thank you.
Also, if you feel you are mentioned in this (and I won’t use anyone’s name in any negative way- or at all without permission) please feel free to contact me. I want to emphasize that I will be talking a lot about my mom and sister and our personal lives and that they are the two most incredible people in my life. I can’t explain where I would be without them and love them more than I could put into words. Anything negative said about them is not to be taken as an insult- as they are fully aware of everything I am writing and are the strongest support team I have.
